🏆 World Cup 2026 Sticker Album – Java CLI App
Welcome to the World Cup 2026 Sticker Album, a Java-based console application developed as part of an academic exercise in Algorithm Construction at Facens University.

This project simulates a classic World Cup sticker album where users can collect, view, search, and sort their figurines (player stickers) in a fun and interactive way — all from the command line!

🚀 Features
✔️ Register your favorite players as stickers
✔️ Display your complete sticker album
✔️ Search for a specific player
✔️ Sort your album alphabetically
✔️ Easy-to-use menu-based navigation

💡 Why this project?
This app was built to practice fundamental programming concepts such as:

Arrays and loops

Switch-case logic

User input handling (Scanner)

Basic validation and data sorting

Modular thinking with reusable methods

It's also a nostalgic nod to those who grew up trading World Cup stickers — this time, powered by Java!

🧠 How it works
The app provides a simple menu:

MENU - WorldCup 2026 Sticker Album
1. Register Stickers
2. Display Complete Album
3. Search for a Player

(Yes, the interface is in Portuguese 🇧🇷 — just like real Brazilian World Cup hype!)

🧠 Key Learnings
This project helped reinforce:

Control flow (do-while, switch)

Defensive programming (checking if album is initialized)

Working with arrays and standard libraries (Arrays.sort)

Building interactive CLI applications
